VISION, MISSION, AND VALUES

VISION
Team Moulton's vision is that every American will share a deep commitment to our country and world, possess the desire to make them better, and have the opportunity to do so.

MISSION
Team Moulton's mission is to serve, and inspire others to serve, in order to improve people's lives and strengthen our democracy.

VALUES
COURAGE
We do not shy away from difficult decisions. We choose to do what is right, even when it is not politically convenient. We stand up for others before ourselves. We understand that courage is not being fearless, but pushing forward in the face of our fears.

EMPATHY
All people deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. We strive to understand people’s perspectives and respectfully communicate our own, especially when we disagree. We approach every interaction with an open mind, reticent to question people’s motives but willing to challenge their judgment.

AUTHENTICITY
We seek out truth, and we are honest and trustworthy in all of our actions. Our stakeholders deserve our complete candor—while they may not always agree with us, they should always know where we stand.

ACTION
We get things done. We seize opportunity, favoring action over inaction. Our team is expected, and empowered, to make a difference every day and to act in the best interest of our constituents, community, and country.

TRANSPARENCY
We believe that openness is a hallmark of good government, and that the timely and free sharing of information makes our team stronger. We seek out effective ways to connect, including the use of technology, in order to improve how we interact with our constituents and each other.

GROWTH
We value knowledge and seek to grow from every experience. We freely admit what we do not know, and we embrace mistakes as learning opportunities. We share, and welcome, feedback in order to improve as individuals and as a team.
